##Conic Sections
A conic section, or just conic, is a curve formed by passing a plane through a right circular cone.  The angular orientation of the plane relative to the cone determines whether the conic section is a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola.  The circle and the ellipse arise when the intersection of cone and plane is a bounded curve.  The circle is a special case of the ellipse in which the plane is perpendicular to the axis of the cone.  If the plane is parallel to a generator line of the cone, the conic is called parabola.  Finally, if the intersection is an unbounded curve and the plane is not parallel to a generator line of the cone the figure is a hyperbola.  In the latter case the plane will intersect both halves of the cone, producing two separate curves.

We can define all conic sections in terms of the eccentricity.  Type of conic section is also related to the semi-major axis and the energy.  The table below shows the relationship between eccentricity, semi-major axis, and energy and the type of conic section.  

Conic Section | Eccentricity (e) | Semi-major axis | Energy
Circle | 0 | = radius | < 0
Ellipse | 0 < e < 1 | > 0 | < 0
Parabola | 1 | infinity | 0
Hyperbola | > 1 | < 0 | > 0

Satellite orbits can be any four conic section.
