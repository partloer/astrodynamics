##Motions of Planets and Satellites
Through a lifelong study of the motions of bodies in the solar system, Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) was able to derive three basic laws known as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Using the data compiled by his mentor Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), Kepler found the following regularities after years of laborious calculations:
1. All planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.
2. A line joining any planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
3. The square of the period of any planet about the sun is proportional to the cube of the planet's mean distance from the sun.

These laws can be deduced from Newton's laws of motion and law of universal gravitation. Indeed, Newton used Kepler's work as basic information in the formulation of his gravitational theory.

As Kepler pointed out, all planets move in elliptical orbits, however, we can learn much about planetary motion by considering the special case of circular orbits. We shall neglect the forces between planets, considering only a planet's interaction with the sun. These considerations apply equally well to the motion of a satellite about a planet.

Let's examine the case of two bodies of masses M and m moving in circular orbits under the influence of each other's gravitational attraction. The center of mass of this system of two bodies lies along the line joining them at a point C such that mr = MR. The large body of mass M moves in an orbit of constant radius R and the small body of mass m in an orbit of constant radius r, both having the same angular velocity . For this to happen, the gravitational force acting on each body must provide the necessary centripetal acceleration. Since these gravitational forces are a simple action-reaction pair, the centripetal forces must be equal but opposite in direction. That is, m2r must equal M2R. The specific requirement, then, is that the gravitational force acting on either body must equal the centripetal force needed to keep it moving in its circular orbit, that is

If one body has a much greater mass than the other, as is the case of the sun and a planet or the Earth and a satellite, its distance from the center of mass is much smaller than that of the other body. If we assume that m is negligible compared to M, then R is negligible compared to r. Thus, equation (4.7) then becomes

4.8

If we express the angular velocity in terms of the period of revolution, W = 2pi/P, we obtain

4.9

where P is the period of revolution. This is a basic equation of planetary and satellite motion. It also holds for elliptical orbits if we define r to be the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit.

A significant consequence of this equation is that it predicts Kepler's third law of planetary motion, that is P<sup>2</sup>~r<sup>3</sup>.

Kepler's second law of planetary motion must, of course, hold true for circular orbits. In such orbits both  and r are constant so that equal areas are swept out in equal times by the line joining a planet and the sun. For elliptical orbits, however, both w and r will vary with time. Let's now consider this case.

Figure 4.5 shows a particle revolving around C along some arbitrary path. The area swept out by the radius vector in a short time interval t is shown shaded. This area, neglecting the small triangular region at the end, is one-half the base times the height or approximately r(r w delta t)/2. This expression becomes more exact as delta t approaches zero, i.e. the small triangle goes to zero more rapidly than the large one. The rate at which area is being swept out instantaneously is therefore

For any given body moving under the influence of a central force, the value wr<sup>2</sup> is constant.

Let's now consider two points P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> in an orbit with radii r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub>, and velocities v<sub>1</sub> and v<sub>2</sub>. Since the velocity is always tangent to the path, it can be seen that if  is the angle between r and v, then

where vsiny is the transverse component of v. Multiplying through by r, we have

rvsinY = wr<sup>2</sup> = constant

or, for two points P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> on the orbital path

4.13

Note that at periapsis and apoapsis,  = 90 degrees. Thus, letting P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> be these two points we get

4.14

From equations (4.14) and (4.15) we obtain

4.17

Rearranging terms we get

The eccentricity e of an orbit is given by

If the semi-major axis a and the eccentricity e of an orbit are known, then the periapsis and apoapsis distances can be calculated by
