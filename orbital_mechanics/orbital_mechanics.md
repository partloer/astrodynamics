#Orbital Mechanics
Astrodynamics or Orbital Mechanics is the study of the motions of artificial satellites and space vehicles moving under the influence of forces such as gravity, atmospheric drag, thrust, etc.  Astrodynamics is a modern offshoot of celestial mechanics which is the study of the motions of natural celestial bodies as the moon and planets.  The root of Astrodynamics can be traced back to the 17th century when mathematician Isaac Newton put forward his laws of motion and formulated his law of universal gravitation.
