#Astrodynamics
Astrodynamics is the study of the motions of artificial satellites and space vehicles moving under the influence of forces such as gravity, atmospheric drag, thrust, etc.  Astrodynamics is a modern offshoot of celestial mechanics which is the study of the motions of natural celestial bodies as the moon and planets.  The root of Astrodynamics can be traced back to the 17th century when mathematician Isaac Newton put forward his laws of motion and formulated his law of universal gravitation.

##Conic Sections
A conic section, or just conic, is a curve formed by passing a plane through a right circular cone.  The angular orientation of the plane relative to the cone determines whether the conic section is a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola.  The circle and the ellipse arise when the intersection of cone and plane is a bounded curve.  The circle is a special case of the ellipse in which the plane is perpendicular to the axis of the cone.  If the plane is parallel to a generator line of the cone, the conic is called parabola.  Finally, if the intersection is an unbounded curve and the plane is not parallel to a generator line of the cone the figure is a hyperbola.  In the latter case the plane will intersect both halves of the cone, producing two separate curves.

We can define all conic sections in terms of the eccentricity.  Type of conic section is also related to the semi-major axis and the energy.  The table below shows the relationship between eccentricity, semi-major axis, and energy and the type of conic section.  

Conic Section | Eccentricity (e) | Semi-major axis | Energy
Circle | 0 | =radius | <0
Ellipse | 0<e<1 | >0 | <0
Parabola | 1 | infinity | 0
Hyperbola | >1 | <0 | >0

Satellite orbits can be any four conic section.

#Orbit Elements
To mathematically describe an orbit one must define six quantities, called orbital elements.
* Semi-Major Axis, a
* Eccentricity, e
* Inclination, i
* Argument of Periapsis,
* Time of Periapsis Passage, T
* Longitude of Ascending Node,
